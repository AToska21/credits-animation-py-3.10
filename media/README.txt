I can't really distribute a full .wav file of an entire song that I don't own the rights to.
That would be disrespectful.

If you want to run this on your own device, you'll need to find yourself a copy of
Frums 「Credits ＬＯＮＧ」

for yourself.
Sorry.

-----------
If you do find a copy, convert it to "credits.wav" and drop it in this /media folder.
